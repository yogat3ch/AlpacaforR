Description: Interact with the Alpaca API and the
     subset of endpoints on the Polygon API`
     available to Alpaca members. All Alpaca
     endpoints are accessible with AlpacaforR:
     Account, Assets, Calendar, Clock,
     Market-Data, Orders, Polygon, Positions,
     Watchlist and Streaming. Get asset, account
     and order info, market calendar info and
     historical market data. Submit, cancel and
     replace simple and complex orders, see
     market open / closing information, and much
     more. Build and test strategies with a
     paper account, then implement them live
     with an Alpaca Brokerage account. If you'd
