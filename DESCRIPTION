Description: Interact with the Alpaca API and the subset of endpoints on
        the Polygon API` available to Alpaca members. All Alpaca
        endpoints are accessible with AlpacaforR: Account, Assets,
        Calendar, Clock, Market-Data, Orders, Polygon, Positions,
        Watchlist and Streaming. Get asset, account and order info,
        market calendar info and historical market data. Submit, cancel
        and replace simple and complex orders, see market open / closing
        information, and much more. Build and test strategies with a
        paper account, then implement them live with an Alpaca Brokerage
        account. If you'd like to provide feedback, submit an issue,
